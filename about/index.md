Taro A. Naoi is currently a data engineer.

Prior to data engineering, he was a data science fellow at Insight Data Science in NYC where he worked on Humor Me, a comedian recommendation platform. Also at one point, he was a Ph.D candidate at Cornell University in the [Materials Science and Engineering Department](http://www.mse.cornell.edu/), studying the structure of amorphous thin films using high energy x-ray diffraction and absorption methods. He applies his knowlege of materials science, physics, and programming to tackle various problems spanning from computational materials to audio classification systems.

His current interests include amorphous materials, music production, audio physics, machine learning, statistics, probabilistic programming, and building scalable data pipelines.

He also makes [music](https://soundcloud.com/japaradise) and writes code under the name Jamie Mori.
