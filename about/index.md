Hi! My name is Taro A. Naoi, though I make [music](https://soundcloud.com/japaradise) and write code under the name Jamie Mori. I'm currently a PhD candidate at Cornell University in the [Materials Science and Engineering Department](http://www.mse.cornell.edu/), where I study materials science and applied physics. 

My initial research interest was to study amorphous materials, however have expanded to much more, including music production, technology, and machine learning. 

Over the years, I've learned A LOT simply by going to the internet and reading other people's posts and rants. I guess this is my way of trying to give back.
