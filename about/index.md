Taro A. Naoi is currently a Ph.D candidate (graduation imminent) at Cornell University in the [Materials Science and Engineering Department](http://www.mse.cornell.edu/), studying the structure of amorphous thin films using high energy x-ray diffraction methods. He applies his knowlege of materials science and physics to tackle various problems spanning from computational materials, to programming audio classification systems.

His current research interests include amorphous materials, music production, audio physics, machine learning, and programming. 

He also makes [music](https://soundcloud.com/japaradise) and writes code under the name Jamie Mori.
